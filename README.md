Website for http://skubo.media

   # What is this
This is the entire content of the website mentioned above. It's not just a static webpage, but intended to be a slimmed down mini CMS to be able to dynamically add and remove content in a very simple form as an "endless full width page" like everybody else is doing nowadays. 

   # Requirements
As my website is hosted by a provider with only PHP installed, this requires PHP. Pages and resources are stored JSON and file based, so no need for a database.
